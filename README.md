This is a location API, providing many of the common building blocks of location. Providing the essential location ingredients needed through a variety of applications, without having to reinvent the wheel each times it is needed. This API is still being working on, and not quite ready for prime time, but if you have any questions, visit the road map and support sections below the documentation.

You can access the public portal landing page for this API at: http://location.apievangelist.com
